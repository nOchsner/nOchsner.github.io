<!--
    Objective: Create an interactive sketch with p5.js 
    that allows users to click a  button that will animate 
    a drawing of your name Add one of the examples from 
    p5.js to your website. Similar to the Turtle project 
    in Java, you will be trying to figure out which lines 
    of code will result in certain lettering. You are free 
    to collaborate with students in this class so that there 
    is no extra work. 


Setting up: 

1. home | p5.js (p5js.org)Links to an external site. <-- Learn more about JS first, 

2. Create a new file titled drawing.html in your itis3135 pages like usual. Make sure to add this page into your navigation bar in the header as well. You also want to make sure your page has the usual elements, like the default styles, the footer, and the h2 tag with the title of this assignment.

3. Next, go ahead and add sketch.js file inside your scripts folder. 

4. Then, go back to the interactiveDrawing.html  (and add these tags to use p5 and the sketch.js

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.8.0/lib/p5.js"></script>
    <script src="scripts/sketch.js"></script>
5. Now you are set to code.  Go ahead and check out this link to learn more: get started | p5.js (p5js.org)Links to an external site.

Assignment: 

1. At this point, you should be a bit familiar with how p5 works. 

2. After setting up for the assignment, the objectives are below.

3. Write code in sketch.js that will implement one of the examples on the p5 website.

4. Upload the changes to your UNCC website. 

End Result

1. Submit https://webpages.charlotte.edu/UNCCID/itis3135/drawing.htmlLinks to an external site.
