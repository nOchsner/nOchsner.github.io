        Welcome to Javascript
    </h3>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a versatile programming language 
        primarily used for web development. It allows 
        developers to create interactive elements, dynamic 
        content, and responsive user interfaces within web 
        pages. As a client-side language, JavaScript runs in 
        the browser, enabling it to manipulate webpage 
        elements, handle events, and communicate with servers 
        asynchronously. Its flexibility and widespread adoption 
        make it an essential tool for building modern web 
        applications, ranging from simple animations to complex 
        web-based software.

        Variables

    <p>
        There are two main methods for create a varible in 
        Javascript. You can use either "let" for general 
        varibles while the use of the word "const" is used
        for values that stay the same.
