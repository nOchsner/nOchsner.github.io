            Creator
        </h3>
        <p class="divit">
            As the creator of "Forging Your JavaScript Skills," I'm Nick Ochsner, 
            and my decision to develop this resource stems from a personal journey 
            with JavaScript. While relatively new to the language, I've garnered a 
            solid understanding across various topics. However, I find myself 
            frequently revisiting concepts and searching for information I believe 
            I should already know. This website not only serves as a tool for 
            reinforcing my JavaScript knowledge but also offers valuable insights 
            for others on a similar learning path.

            practical application. I believe that by sharing my insights,

            at all levels to embark on their journey of mastering this 
            versatile language. Whether you're a beginner taking your first
