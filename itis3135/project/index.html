            JavaScript is a versatile programming language commonly used 
            in web development to create interactive and dynamic content. 
            Initially developed by Brendan Eich in 1995, JavaScript has 
            evolved into a fundamental component of modern web applications. 
            It runs on the client side within web browsers, enabling 
            developers to manipulate web page elements, handle user 
            interactions, and communicate with servers asynchronously. 
            With its wide range of libraries and frameworks, JavaScript 
            facilitates the development of responsive and engaging web 
            experiences, making it an indispensable tool for building 
            interactive websites and web applications.

<!--
    Foundational Website Build/Design 

    
    Develop fully functional HTML and CSS code for a minimum of 5 
    pages. All code should be  separate i.e. CSS and JS in 
    separate files.
    
    
    Entry or Home page â€“ This page should have a layout using 
    header, main, footer,  and use ids and classes WHERE 
    NECESSARY (and not, where not necessary). The page should 
    have actual content (text, images, videos,  etc.) including 
    the navigation bar. This page should be named index.html. 
    

    When in doubt, start by coming up with who, what, when, where, 
    why, and how to easily create starter pages (who becomes about, 
    what could be home, when could be a calendar, or operating hours, 
    or shipping times, and so on).
