Project overview: 

    Describe your application and its purpose.

    Intended users of the website. 

    Overview of the content of the website 



Client Information: (If for any reason you believe 
this material should not be published on the web - 
replace the information with something like 
[private]. This might make sense with email or 
phone or name, but NOT with the business/idea/concept- 
as these will be public this semester, one way or the 
other. If that's not possible, find another client. 

    Name of the client

    Organization/Institute/Business the client/s are associated with

    Client’s valid email address

    Client’s phone number (if they are willing to share) 



Wireframe: Using your UNCC google account, connect 
draw.io to your google drive, and using the built-in 
tools create a wireframe for the default page design 
for your project. Share the image and link to it from 
within the design doc page, and then embed it nicely 
with figure and figcaption. 



Site Map: Before you start coding, you need to understand 
what pages you will need to create  and how you will navigate
between them. Below is an example of a site map. Use Draw.io 
to create the sitemap. Share the image and link to it from 
within your design doc page, and then embed it nicely with 
figure and figcaption. 

Your website must have 5 or more pages, including

    A home page (index.html) 

    Navigation Bar that enables single-clicks to each of the 
    
    five pages (if you have more, submenus are OK, as appropriate)
    
    Component header and footers that are consistent across the web application (footers  should include HTML and CSS validation links)
    
    Interactivity using JavaScript/jQuery 
    
    jQuery-UI widget and other plugins 
    
    AJAX functionality



Page Design: For each page listed in your site map, 
provide at least the following information:

    The name of the page

    Purpose of the page

    Audience/Users of page (customer, admin, etc.)

    What will be content of the page? 

    Is this a page where you are asking users to enter 
    data on the page?

    Will those data fields need any validations (if any)? 

    Will the page contain buttons or hyperlinks or drop downs?

    What actions will happen in the page? (such as, 
    when user clicks on a button - data processed, 
    navigate to other page, search based on value, etc.?)



Any special notes regarding the page (if any)?



Dynamic Functionality on the website: Describe the dynamic 
functionality you will implement  using JavaScript- this 
is a description of the interactivity, for example, forms, 
calculators,  interactive images, photo gallery that you 
wish to implement on your website. Specify the name of the 
page where you plan to use a certain interactivity and why. 
Provide  example of URLs of web pages/websites where you 
have seen this sort of interactivity.
