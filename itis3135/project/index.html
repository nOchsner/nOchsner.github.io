    Foundational Website Build/Design 


    In this assignment, you will develop and submit an initial 
    design of your web application project.  The design of your 
    web site should be relevant to the type of service it is 
    providing. Choose your  style, layout and content by looking 
    at examples of pages for similar purposes. Below is a generic  
    set of specifications for what you need to have completed for 
    the initial design.  

    
    Develop fully functional HTML and CSS code for a minimum of 5 
    pages. All code should be  separate i.e. CSS and JS in 
    separate files.
    
    
    Entry or Home page – This page should have a layout using 
    header, main, footer,  and use ids and classes WHERE 
    NECESSARY (and not, where not necessary). The page should 
    have actual content (text, images, videos,  etc.) including 
    the navigation bar. This page should be named index.html. 
    

    Navigation bar – All pages should have a consistent and 
    working navigation bar.  The navigation bar should have links 
    to all the pages you are going to have in your  website. The 
    navigation bar should be at the same position on all the pages.  
    

    4 Other Pages – These should have the navigation bar. They can 
    be Product,  Informational or Service pages or any other page 
    you will like to have. You must  include the content for these 
    pages. Choose names that pertains to your website  and the 
    purpose of the page e,g “Testimonials”, “Projects”.  Note that 
    the page name displayed may be slightly different from the 
    actual file name, but should be easily connected (i.e. Page 
    page might be "About Us" or even "About CompanyName" and file 
    name could be about.html)
    

    When in doubt, start by coming up with who, what, when, where, 
    why, and how to easily create starter pages (who becomes about, 
    what could be home, when could be a calendar, or operating hours, 
    or shipping times, and so on).
