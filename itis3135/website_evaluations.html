                This website is used for streaming videos.

                <li>
                    Contrast, Depending on if you're on light or 
                    dark mode it either has a black background and
                    white text or white background and black text.
                    Pretty good contrast.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repetition, On my device there were three videos
                    per row repeated as you scroll down. Split into
                    repeated sections of different types of videos
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alignment, For me the videos were three
                    in every row and well spaced out to define
                    one from another. Clear and easy to understand
                    layout.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Proximity, Groups related videos get put 
                    together in sections and options and menu
                    items are grouped together at different
                    parts of the page

                <li>
                    Contrast, White background with black text,
                    simple but it definitely has contrast.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repetition, Good repition of listing clues and
                    other games and info at the bottom.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alignment, This is where I drew issue with
                    this site. When completing the mini on my pc
                    because if you were to fit te crossword to screen
                    then there's a huge blank space to the right. It 
                    is annoying to look to the right for the next clue
                    only to need to look up a bit more because you looked
                    at the wrong spot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Proximity, Also does well with proximity by
                    keeping related items like clues or other
                    available games close together in sections.
                </li>

<!--

Black is a difficult color to see so it would also be nivce to change

Italicize the figure caption

Since your chosing to center the header, center the footer so it matches
