            <li>
                The submission leads to the about page of the site. There doesn't
                seem to be a home page so I found that this is fine.
            </li>
            <li>
                From what I can tell everything has correct labeling and looks great.
                Except for pictures, where some of their names start with capital 
                letters.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Design:</span>
                <ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        This page has amazing contrast and color scheme in general.
                        The font size and the colors make this site an easy read.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This site has its own style sheet. Though it also does follow
                        the style of the class course pages.
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Contrast - The colors are soft and yet still do an amazing 
                            job at contrasting eachother so that the page is easy and 
                            fun to read.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Repetition - The common length that the same properties take 
                            up help this project feel as one giant thing rather than just
                            a bunch of text put together.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Alignment - Basically the same thing as repition but the text, 
                            pictures, and everything else is well aligned and gives a 
                            sense of responsibility and organization.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Proximity - Some of the parts could do with a bit more space 
                            between them but other than that, this is also good.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Page Has Required elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                The pages have well organized headers that describe what the project is. 
                Both in the title and on the page.
            </li>
            <li>
                The main element does start with an h2 header and doesn't include the name 
                of the site.
            </li>
            <li>
                None of the pages include a slogan or tagline.
            </li>
            <li>
                The pages do not include validation nor does it have a menu for the 
                users pages. Though I'm not sure if these are actually required per 
                the instructions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Other than not having a unique design compared to the class pages, this 
                project was really good.
            </li>
            <li>
                I really enjoyed reviewing your project. I hope this has helped and have 
                a fun time finishing your project up.
