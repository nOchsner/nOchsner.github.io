                    What are video games? Who invented them? These are just
                    some questions I do not know the answer to. On a more 
                    important note, I enjoy playing video games as a hobby.
                    What games do I enjoy playing? Recently I've been
                    replaying a game called Elden Ring. While it is
                    definitely not my favorite game I've ever played, it is
                    still a game that I've gotten a lot of joy out of
                    playing.

                    This is a game console. There are many different kinds of
                    game consoles and people use a myriad of different consoles.
                    A lot of people also use PC's to play video games. Some video
                    games are specific to specific consoles. There are so many
                    interesting things about video games.

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    As briefly metioned in the Home section, I've recently
                    been playing a game called Elden Ring. A fun fact is that
                    the game is actually based on a true story, do not fact
                    check this statement. What I find most appealing about this
                    game is its difficulty. It is one of the most difficult games
                    I've ever played and I find it fun playing it. Another fun
                    fact is that this game is nearly 20 years old, do not fact 
                    check this statement either. I find video games fun and there 
                    are many reasons that I'd find a game fun.

                <p>
                    That's right, I'll be answering the question that everyone has
                    been asking. Where can you play video games? This may surprise
                    you but you can actually play video games anywhere. Are you at
                    a funeral and need cheering up? Well set up you gaming console 
                    near by and you and mourn the death of someone while getting
                    that win in fortnite. Are you in a hospital? Well unplug some 
                    of that useless life-saving machines and set up you gaming 
                    console to play minecraft. The possibilities are endless. Play
                    video games anywhere, nobody is going to stop you.

                <p>
                    Because people like having access to play video games anywhere 
                    there have been developments letting people have a more mobile
                    gaming experience. To examples of this are the Nintendo Switch 
                    and the Steam Deck. Both of these systems are well made and 
                    customers who purchase these products have been known to enjoy 
                    them. Truely there is no place you cannot play a video game.

                <h2>
                    How To Play Video Games
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Video games are fun to play but setting up your system to have
                    quick and easy access to the games you like is important. The 
                    first thing you need to play video games is a system to play
                    on. You could choose a gaming console like an Xbox or Nintendo 
                    Switch. You can also just play games on your home PC if you'd
                    prefer. If all else fails and you have a mobile phone, there 
                    may be a game app you can download.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once you have chosen your system it is now time to pick the 
                    game you'd like to play. There are a myriad of options available
                    which allows for basically endless gameplay. Once you have chosen 
                    you game all you need to do is purchase and/or download it. You now
                    have a video game that you can play anywhere. That was easy.

                <h2>
                    Why Video Games?
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Why should you choose video games over any other
                    type of game. There are board games, card games, 
                    etc; and they can be very different. Why video games
                    are so liked is the ease of access and easy customization.
                    For example, you could play a card game in real life but 
                    you'd need a deck of cards, you'd need to shuffle it, etc;
                    but the ability to customize and add automated features to
                    video games is a large benefit.
                </p>

                        Why do people enjoy video games?

                </figure>
                <p class="fig-para">
                    The prompt I used to get this image was "question

                    realistic style". 
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are also more benefits to video games. Many genres
                    of games can be only created in video games. This is why 
                    people choose video games. The ability to basically create 
                    any game you can imagine due to the power of computers is 
                    what drove the way for video games to become as popular as
                    they have. This fact is why I choose to play video games 
                    and I hope this has helped give insight on why.

                    Similar to "Where can you play video games?" this question 
                    also deals with the specific situation in which you can 
                    play video games. Starting with the answer: You can play video
                    games at any time of the day or night. This is a fact and we 
                    will also explore specific situations in which you can play 
                    video games.

                    Is it 3am on a school night? That may be true but all I 
                    hear is that it is the perfect time to start playing 
                    video games. You may not get any sleep but you got to 
                    play video games so thats a win. This is just one example 
                    of a time when it may not seem obvious to play video games.
