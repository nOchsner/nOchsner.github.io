                    with the DOM. This will also include practice question

            Wireframe: Using your UNCC google account, connect 
            draw.io to your google drive, and using the built-in 
            tools create a wireframe for the default page design 
            for your project. Share the image and link to it from

            Site Map: Before you start coding, you need to understand 
            what pages you will need to create  and how you will navigate
            between them. Below is an example of a site map. Use Draw.io 
            to create the sitemap. Share the image and link to it from 
            within your design doc page, and then embed it nicely with 
            figure and figcaption.

            Page Design: For each page listed in your site map, 
            provide at least the following information:

                The name of the page

                Purpose of the page

                Audience/Users of page (customer, admin, etc.)

                What will be content of the page? 

                Is this a page where you are asking users to enter 
                data on the page?

                Will those data fields need any validations (if any)? 

                Will the page contain buttons or hyperlinks or drop downs?

                What actions will happen in the page? (such as, 
                when user clicks on a button - data processed, 
                navigate to other page, search based on value, etc.?)



            Any special notes regarding the page (if any)?
