                    This Application will help serve as an introduction
                    to JavaScript. It will not only give information on 
                    how to utilize JavaScript but also have interactive
                    sections.

                    Intended to not only to teach users and introduction

                    more experience users can quickly refresh their minds

                    This Website will be split into parts describing the

                    Starting with simple variable declarations to interating
                    with the DOM. This will also include practice question

                    This page is to serve as a home page for the website. 
                    It'll tell the users what this website will provide 
                    for them and more. This page is meant for users that

                    main pages, as respresented in the site map, and will 
                    serve as an introduction. There will be no need for

                    This is one of the two main sections. This page will 
                    also include a second nav-bar of sorts to navigate 
                    through the various Topic sections. The Topic pages 
                    are more of sub-pages to the main learning page. The 
                    main audience for this part is for learning the 
                    content rather than being tested on it.

                    This will include much interactivity and actions 
                    through the use of JavaScript. It'll have practice 
                    and learning parts to help with the learning of 
                    certain JavaScript topics. These pages will serve 
                    mostly as a precursor to the Quizzes pages in which 
                    users will be tested on their knowledge. This part 
                    will include interactivity to not only allow users to see
                    how their code can affect the DOM but also the structor 
                    that JavaScript follows by teaching them how it works.

                    This is the second of the two main pages. Whether the 
                    use of this pages is to test your knowledge on JavaScript 
                    or as practice after running through the learning pages 
                    this will serve as a way for general users to test their 
                    knowledge.

                    The content of these Quizzes pages will be to test the 
                    users on specific topic. The sub-pages will be used to 
                    differentiate between the different Quizzes based on the 
                    topic that the user would like to be tested on. This part 
                    will include interactivity to not only allow users to see
                    how their code can affect the DOM and also the structure 
                    that JavaScript follows by testing them.

                    action. This pages content is really only meant to 
                    serve as a source for some general information. There 
                    will be multiple sections to it but it will mostly be

                    Similar to the home page this page will be primarly
                    to inform rather than have any interactivity. This 
                    page will include questions that a user of this 
                    website may have. For example: "How do you access
                    the Quiz answers?". This would come with a response
                    given in detail on how the users can see the answers 
                    to the quizzes to they know what they got wrong and

                    so there is no need to elaborate on that. As for its
