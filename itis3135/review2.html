                I couldn't find the Project so I've linked the Project Overview page
            </li>
            <li>
                From what I can tell everything has correct labeling and looks great.
                Except for pictures, where some of their names start with capital 
                letters.
            </li>
            <li>
                Design:
                <ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        This page has amazing contrast and color scheme in general.
                        The font size and the colors make this site an easy read.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This site has its own style sheet. Though it also does follow
                        the style of the class course pages.
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Contrast - Well contrasted but does look a little off. Though 
                            I am typically used to dark-mode pages where the text is 
                            white.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Repetition - Again, this is their project overview page which 
                            requires many unique parts but most of the text follows the 
                            same guidelines.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Alignment - Some lists are centered making them difficult to 
                            read. Other parts are left aligned but because of the small 
                            amount of text they appear to be heavely weighted to the left 
                            size of the page.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Proximity - Every thing is evenly space. Though there should 
                            be more space between two different section than there is space 
                            between a title and its section. I think doing this help to 
                            differentiate the different sections.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Page Has Required elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                The pages have well organized headers that describe what the project is. 
                Both in the title and on the page.
            </li>
            <li>
                This main element for this page starts with an h1 header but doesn't 
                include the name of the site so that's good.
            </li>
            <li>
                None of the pages include a slogan or tagline.
            </li>
            <li>
                The page does include validations and a menu but the page is still also 
                part of the school course pages.
            </li>
            <li>
                This project probably didn't meet most of the standards as per the 
                instructions. I'm really just reviewing the overview page because I can not 
                find the actual project itself.
            </li>
            <li>
                If I somehow missed your project on your homepage, I'm sorry. I couldn't 
                find it but despite that, by looking at the overview it looks like you 
                have a pretty good idea for your project coming along. I hope this has 
                helped and have a fun time finishing your project up.
