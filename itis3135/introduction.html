                        Personal Background:
                    </span>
                    I was born on the planet earth, 
                    and more specifically in a hospital, 
                    where I then grew up just outside 
                    South Carolina to the north.

                        Professional Background:
                    </span>
                    I worked at the movie theaters. It 
                    was kinda fun.

                        Academic Background:
                    </span>
                    I went to a public elementary, 
                    middle, and high school where I did 
                    NOT fail a single class. I then 
                    made the wise decision to be accepted 
                    into UNC Charlotte and have been 
                    pursuing a degree in computer science.

                    Though I did not directly invent the 
                    entire internet, I do have some

                    I primarily use a laptop that runs a

                            I am taking this course because I chose it 
                            like 2 months ago and never bothered to 
                            switch it to another class.

                            this class sounded easy. Also 3163 is a 
                            prime number which is really cool if you 
                            think about it. Well not “really” cool but 
                            somewhat interesting.

                    I have this really cool laptop that runs an obscure and not well known operating system called Windows 11. This answer is NOT the same as my answer to the “Primary Computer Platform” section.
