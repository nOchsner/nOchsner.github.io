                    Personal Background:
                </span>
                I was born on the planet earth, 
                and more specifically in a hospital, 
                where I then grew up just outside 
                South Carolina to the north.

                    Professional Background:
                </span>
                I worked at the movie theaters. It 
                was kinda fun.

                    Academic Background:
                </span>
                I went to a public elementary, 
                middle, and high school where I did 
                NOT fail a single class. I then 
                made the wise decision to be accepted 
                into UNC Charlotte and have been 
                pursuing a degree in computer science.

                Though I did not directly invent the 
                entire internet, I do have some 
                experience with using javascript.

                I primarily use a laptop that runs a

                        I'm not technically taking this class but

                        I am taking this course because I chose it 
                        like 2 months ago and never bothered to 
                        switch it to another class.

                        The internet is cool and learning about Web

                        I need a math class for my math minor and 
                        this class sounded easy. Also 3163 is a 
                        prime number which is really cool if you 
                        think about it. Well not “really” cool but 
                        somewhat interesting.

                I have this really cool laptop that runs an obscure and not well known operating system called Windows 11. This answer is NOT the same as my answer to the “Primary Computer Platform” section.
