<!--
    Then, Make a webpage (about.html) that matches your other pages (identical headers/footers/css/etc) and include it in your common navigation.

    In the main element after your h2 page name include a paragraph or two about the business idea (what it does/sells). 
    Come up with a slogan/tagline (this is not a mission/vision statement). Include this somewhere in your header OR footer, and (and update all headers/footers to match). It should be in italics OR quotes, but not both. When deciding, ask if it's something you imagine people saying out loud (quotes) or more describing (italics). Use strong/em, not b/i. 
    You're going to be taking a bit of liberty with this- since you might have a name like "Salty Dog" and want to sell crochet fingerless gloves - but just roll with it. Or find something that fits better (either by swapping the mascot or the business idea). This should be fun, or at least not painful- and relies on you picking something you either care about, or are willing to care about enough to find some examples for. 

    From now on, all your pages should incorporate this theme somehow - and by looking at the page this should be obvious.
